# Service Overview

The AI-Agent-API service is a production-ready FastAPI application that provides Claude SDK integration with comprehensive session management, task automation, and real-time communication capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

### Claude SDK Integration

- **Official Claude Agent SDK**: Direct integration with Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time message streaming with WebSocket support
- **Token Tracking**: Comprehensive API usage monitoring and cost calculation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and session state management

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **MCP Framework**: Full Model Context Protocol support for tool integration
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime MCP server configuration and management
- **Tool Access Control**: Permission-based tool usage with audit trails
- **External Server Integration**: Connect to external MCP servers for extended functionality

### Session Management

- **Stateful Conversations**: Persistent conversation sessions with full history
- **Session Lifecycle**: Complete state management (Created → Active → Processing → Completed)
- **Session Forking**: Create new sessions based on existing conversation history
- **Working Directories**: Isolated file system workspace per session

### Task Automation

- **Repeatable Operations**: Define and execute repeatable agent tasks
- **Template System**: Jinja2-based prompt templates with variable substitution
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based task scheduling with automated execution
- **Report Generation**: Automated report creation in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML, PDF)

## Business Value

### For Developers

- **API-First Design**: RESTful API with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security with role-based access control
- **Multi-tenancy**: Organization and user-based data isolation

### For Operations Teams

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Sentry error tracking
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all user actions and system events
- **Quota Management**: User-based rate limiting and resource quotas
- **Storage Management**: Automated file management with archival and cleanup

### For AI Workflows

- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with external tools via MCP
- **Permission System**: Granular control over tool access and execution
- **Cost Tracking**: Detailed API usage and cost monitoring
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain conversation state across application restarts

## Use Cases

### Interactive AI Sessions

```yaml
Scenario: Developer needs AI assistance with code analysis
Flow:
  1. Create session with appropriate MCP tools
  2. Send messages via WebSocket for real-time interaction
  3. AI uses tools (file_read, git_status, etc.) with permission prompts
  4. Session state persists for later continuation
```

### Automated Task Execution

```yaml
Scenario: Scheduled code review automation
Flow:
  1. Define task template with code review prompt
  2. Configure cron schedule for execution
  3. Task executes automatically with repository context
  4. Generated report sent via configured notifications
```

### Multi-user Collaboration

```yaml
Scenario: Team sharing AI assistance workflows
Flow:
  1. Admin creates organization with user quotas
  2. Users create sessions with shared MCP configurations
  3. Session forking enables collaborative workflow development
  4. Audit trails provide visibility into team usage
```

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies

- **Claude API**: Direct integration with Anthropic's Claude models
- **MCP Servers**: External Model Context Protocol servers for tool integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data persistence layer
- **Redis**: Session state and caching layer

### Downstream Consumers

- **Web Frontend**: React application consuming REST API and WebSocket streams
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for automated task execution
- **External Systems**: Webhook integrations for task completion notifications
- **Monitoring Systems**: Prometheus metrics and Sentry error reporting

## Service Boundaries

### What This Service Does

- **Session Lifecycle Management**: Create, manage, and persist AI conversation sessions
- **Claude SDK Orchestration**: Handle Claude API interactions with proper error handling
- **MCP Configuration**: Manage Model Context Protocol server configurations
- **User Authorization**: Authenticate and authorize user actions with RBAC
- **Resource Management**: Track usage quotas and manage file system resources

### What This Service Doesn't Do

- **Model Training**: No AI model training or fine-tuning capabilities  
- **File Storage Backend**: Uses external storage systems (local/S3) for persistence
- **Identity Provider**: Delegates to external authentication systems
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Integrates with external monitoring (Prometheus/Sentry)
- **Message Broker**: Uses Redis but doesn't provide general-purpose messaging

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

- **Async/Await Architecture**: Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
- **Connection Pooling**: Database and Redis connection management
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless design enables multiple instance deployment
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Redis-based WebSocket session sharing across instances

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: Efficient SQLAlchemy models with lazy loading
- **Storage**: Configurable working directory cleanup and archival
- **Network**: Claude API rate limiting with exponential backoff
- **Database**: Optimized queries with proper indexing strategy

### Reliability

- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against external service failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors when MCP servers are unavailable
- **Transaction Management**: Proper database transaction boundaries
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
