## Test Infrastructure

### Database Setup
```python
# Async database engine with test database
@pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope="function")
async def async_engine():
    """Create async database engine for tests."""
    engine = create_async_engine(TEST_DATABASE_URL, echo=False)
    # Create all tables
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
    yield engine
    # Drop all tables
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.drop_all)
    await engine.dispose()
```

### Session Management
```python
@pytest_asyncio.fixture
async def db_session(async_engine) -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    """Create database session for tests."""
    async_session_maker = async_sessionmaker(
        bind=async_engine,
        class_=AsyncSession,
        expire_on_commit=False,
    )
    async with async_session_maker() as session:
        yield session
```

### Test Data Fixtures
- `test_organization`: Create test organization
- `test_user`: Create test user
- `admin_user`: Create admin user
- `test_session_model`: Create test session
- Mock fixtures for external services
