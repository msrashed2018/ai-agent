# API Testing and Documentation Task

**Task ID:** API-TEST-DOC-001
**Created:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** In Progress
**Assignee:** Claude AI Agent

---

## Objective

Systematically test, review, and document all 60 API endpoints (59 REST + 1 WebSocket) in the AI Agent API to ensure:
1. Each API works as expected
2. Code quality and best practices are followed
3. Issues are identified and documented
4. Critical enhancements are proposed where needed
5. Comprehensive documentation is created for each API group

---

## Scope

Based on the API inventory (`docs/apis/api-inventory.md`), we have 9 API groups to test and document:

| # | API Group | Endpoints | Priority | Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Authentication APIs | 3 | High | Pending |
| 2 | Session APIs | 17 | High | Pending |
| 3 | Session Template APIs | 8 | Medium | Pending |
| 4 | Task APIs | 8 | Medium | Pending |
| 5 | Report APIs | 3 | Medium | Pending |
| 6 | MCP Server APIs | 9 | Medium | Pending |
| 7 | Admin APIs | 3 | Low | Pending |
| 8 | WebSocket APIs | 1 | High | Pending |
| 9 | Monitoring APIs | 7 | High | Pending |

**Total:** 59 endpoints

---

## Methodology

For each API group, follow this process:

### 1. Preparation Phase
- Read existing documentation (if any)
- Identify source code files
- Review database models and schemas
- Understand dependencies

### 2. Testing Phase (Manual - No Scripts)
- Start local development environment
- Authenticate and obtain JWT token
- Test each endpoint using `curl` commands
- Test happy path scenarios
- Test error scenarios (missing auth, invalid data, not found, etc.)
- Document actual responses
- Measure response times

### 3. Code Review Phase
Review each endpoint's implementation for:

#### a. Code Quality
- Clean code principles
- Separation of concerns
- Proper naming conventions
- Code duplication
- Function/method complexity

#### b. Error Handling
- Proper exception handling
- Meaningful error messages
- Correct HTTP status codes
- Error logging
- No sensitive data in errors

#### c. Security
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (if applicable)
- Sensitive data handling

#### d. Performance
- Database query efficiency
- N+1 query problems
- Proper indexing usage
- Caching opportunities
- Pagination implementation

#### e. Architecture
- Service layer separation
- Repository pattern usage
- Dependency injection
- Domain model integrity
- HATEOAS implementation

#### f. Testing
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test coverage
- Test quality and assertions
- Edge case coverage

#### g. Documentation
- Docstrings present and accurate
- Type hints
- API documentation
- Code comments (where needed)

### 4. Documentation Phase

Create comprehensive documentation for each API group following the format in `docs/apis/session-templates-management.md`:

#### Document Structure:
1. **Title and Metadata**
   - Base URL
   - Authentication requirements
   - API version

2. **Table of Contents**
   - Links to each endpoint

3. **For Each Endpoint:**
   - API Endpoint table (Method, Path, Status, Auth)
   - cURL command with realistic examples
   - Request body schema (if applicable)
   - Response example (success case)
   - Backend processing steps table
   - Error response examples

4. **Summary Section:**
   - Summary table of all endpoints
   - Common error responses
   - Authentication setup guide

5. **Additional Sections:**
   - Known issues and limitations
   - Best practices for using the API
   - Common use cases
   - Performance considerations

### 5. Issue Identification

For each issue found, document:
- **Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Category:** Security / Performance / Code Quality / Documentation
- **Description:** What is the issue?
- **Impact:** How does it affect the system?
- **Location:** File path and line numbers
- **Recommendation:** How to fix it?
- **Priority:** Must Fix / Should Fix / Nice to Have

### 6. Enhancement Proposals

For each enhancement, document:
- **Type:** Feature / Performance / Developer Experience
- **Description:** What should be added/improved?
- **Justification:** Why is this valuable?
- **Implementation Effort:** Low / Medium / High
- **Priority:** Critical / Nice to Have
- **Backward Compatibility:** Yes / No / N/A

   - Required to get tokens for other API testing
   - Document: `docs/apis/authentication-management.md`

2. **Monitoring APIs** (7 endpoints)
   - Health checks (system, database, SDK, storage)
   - Cost tracking endpoints
   - Session metrics
   - Document: `docs/apis/monitoring-management.md`

### Phase 2: Core Session APIs (Days 3-5)
**Priority:** High - Core functionality

3. **Session APIs** (17 endpoints)
   - Core session operations (create, read, list, query, delete)
   - Session control (resume, pause)
   - Session data access (messages, tool-calls, workdir)
   - Advanced operations (fork, archive, hooks, permissions, metrics)
   - Document: `docs/apis/session-management.md`

4. **WebSocket APIs** (1 endpoint)
   - Real-time session streaming
