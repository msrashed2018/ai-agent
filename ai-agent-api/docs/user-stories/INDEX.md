## DevOps Use Case: Complete Flow

### The Vision
A complete AI-powered DevOps monitoring and investigation platform:

```
1. ALERT RECEIVED (US001)
   ↓
   Prometheus alert: "High CPU on pod web-app-xyz"
   ↓
   Event trigger matches → Starts investigation workflow

2. WORKFLOW STARTS (US002)
   ↓
   "Pod Crash Investigation" workflow activated
   ↓
   Multi-agent team assembled (US005)

3. PARALLEL INVESTIGATION (US003 + US005)
   ↓
   Security Agent:  Checks security logs and policies
   Performance Agent: Queries Prometheus metrics
   Cost Agent: Analyzes cloud cost impact
   Logs Agent: Searches application logs in Loki
   ↓
   All agents work simultaneously

4. KNOWLEDGE SEARCH (US004)
   ↓
   Search: "Similar pod crashes in last 6 months"
   ↓
   Found: 3 similar incidents, all resolved by increasing memory

5. COORDINATOR SYNTHESIZES
   ↓
   Root Cause: Memory leak in version 2.5
   Solution: Rollback to 2.4, increase memory limit
   Evidence: Logs show OutOfMemoryError, metrics show spike
   Past Success: This solution worked 3/3 times before

6. HUMAN CHECKPOINT (US002)
   ↓
   Slack notification to @sre-oncall
   "Approve rollback of web-app to v2.4?"
   ↓
   SRE reviews findings and approves

7. REMEDIATION
   ↓
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-app
   kubectl set resources deployment/web-app --limits=memory=2Gi

8. VERIFICATION
   ↓
   Agent monitors pod status, logs, metrics
   Confirms: Pod stable, no crashes, memory usage normal

9. RCA REPORT (US002 + US004)
   ↓
   Generate comprehensive post-mortem
   Save to knowledge base for future incidents
   ↓
   Total time: 8 minutes (vs 45 minutes manual investigation)
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Dynamic & Extensible (like n8n)
The platform is designed to be **workflow-driven** and **tool-agnostic**, similar to n8n:

- **Workflows** (US002) can be customized for any use case
- **MCP Tools** (US003) can connect to any external system
- **Knowledge Base** (US004) learns from any domain
- **Agent Profiles** (US005) can be specialized for any expertise
- **Event Sources** (US001) can trigger from any monitoring system

### 2. Industry-Agnostic Core
While initially designed for DevOps, the core features serve any industry:

- **Event-driven automation** applies to: alerts, transactions, tickets, messages
- **Workflows** apply to: investigations, approvals, processes, analysis
- **Observability** applies to: infrastructure, applications, business metrics, IoT
- **Knowledge** applies to: runbooks, SOPs, case studies, regulations
- **Multi-agent** applies to: any multi-faceted problem requiring expertise

### 3. Composability
Features can be used independently or combined:

- **US001 only**: Simple event-triggered tasks
- **US001 + US002**: Event → Structured investigation workflow
- **US002 + US004**: Workflow with knowledge-augmented steps
- **US002 + US005**: Workflow with multi-agent collaboration
- **All Combined**: Full-featured AI-powered automation platform

## Implementation Considerations
