# AI-Agent-API-Service - Service Overview & Business Capabilities

## What is AI-Agent-API-Service?

AI-Agent-API-Service is an enterprise platform that enables you to integrate Claude AI coding capabilities into your workflows through a persistent, multi-user service. It transforms Claude Code from a command-line tool into a scalable API service that teams can use for automated code analysis, security audits, documentation generation, and intelligent software development tasks.

**In Simple Terms**: Imagine having an expert AI developer on-call 24/7 that you can:
- Ask questions about your codebase
- Request security audits automatically
- Generate documentation on schedule
- Execute repetitive coding tasks
- Analyze code quality and suggest improvements

All through a simple web API, without needing to manually run command-line tools.

## Core Concepts

### Sessions - Interactive AI Conversations

**What it is**: A session is like a conversation with an AI developer that has access to a specific project directory. You can ask questions, request analyses, and get coding assistance interatively.

**How it works**:
1. You create a session pointing to your project directory
2. You send messages (questions or requests) to Claude
3. Claude analyzes your code using various tools (reading files, searching, running commands)
4. You get intelligent responses based on your actual codebase
5. The conversation continues with full context from previous messages

**Business Value**:
- **Code Understanding**: Ask "How does authentication work in this project?"
- **Interactive Analysis**: Have back-and-forth conversations to drill down into complex issues
- **Persistent Context**: Claude remembers the entire conversation history
- **Work Continuity**: Pause and resume sessions days later without losing context

**Example Use Case**:
A new developer joins your team. Instead of spending days reading documentation, they create a session and ask: "What are the main components of this application and how do they interact?" Claude analyzes the codebase and provides an architectural overview with specific file references.

---

### Tasks - Automated AI Workflows

**What it is**: A task is a reusable template that automates specific AI-powered activities. Unlike sessions where you write messages each time, tasks use pre-defined prompts with variable placeholders.

**How it works**:
1. You create a task template with a prompt like "Analyze {{directory}} for {{issue_type}}"
2. You execute the task providing values: directory="/src/auth", issue_type="SQL injection"
3. Claude automatically performs the analysis without you writing a custom message
4. Results are saved, and optionally a report is generated

**Business Value**:
- **Repeatability**: Define once, run many times with different parameters
- **Automation**: Schedule tasks to run daily, weekly, or on-demand
- **Consistency**: Same analysis process every time, reducing human error
- **Scalability**: Run dozens of tasks across multiple projects simultaneously

**Example Use Case**:
Your security team wants to audit all microservices weekly for common vulnerabilities. Create one task template for "security audit", then schedule it to run against each service's codebase every Monday at 2 AM. Reports are automatically generated and emailed to the security team.

### Key Difference: Sessions vs Tasks

| **When to Use Sessions** | **When to Use Tasks** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Exploring unfamiliar code | Repetitive analysis you do regularly |
| Debugging complex issues interactively | Scheduled compliance checks |
| Getting architectural explanations | Automated code quality reports |
| Pair programming with AI | CI/CD integration for pre-deployment checks |
| Ad-hoc questions | Standardized team workflows |

**Simple Rule**: If you're having a conversation, use a **Session**. If you're automating a process, use a **Task**.
